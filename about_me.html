        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>Hello! I'm Nandith Narayan, and I'm currently studying Computer Science as an Undergraduate at Florida Tech.</p>
        <p>My interests include Competitive Programming, Emulator Development, Formal Methods, Computer Graphics, Video Games, Virtual Reality and, Machine Learning.
            Currently, I work as an undergraduate research assistant at the ASSIST Lab at Florida Tech which, has allowed me to use formal methods to verify the behavior of autonomous systems.
            I enjoy designing 3D models and animations in the modelling software, blender.
            I'm fascinated by machine learning and have created a few projects that revolve around it.
            I occasionally dabble in digital logic circuits and design amateur printed circuit boards.
            Recently, I've become very interesting in emulation and how emulators work in general which, has led me to develop a Game Boy Color emulator in my free time.
            </p>

        <p>I also partake in Competitive Programming contests as a member of Florida Tech's Competitive Programming club.
            During my free time, I like to work on my side-projects, watch movies, go to rocket launches, and play video games.</p>
